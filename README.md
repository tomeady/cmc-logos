Coinmarketcap.com logos

Coinmarketcap.com has recently changed the filenames of the cryptocurrency logos.

For example:
Instead of ethereum.png, it's now 1027.png.

This script parses https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/views/all/ and maps the coin ids to the new logo ids. Then it downloads all logos and saves them with their old coin id.

Getting Started:

- Simply alter the global variables as you please.
- Run the file using an interpreter at or above 3.4.2.
